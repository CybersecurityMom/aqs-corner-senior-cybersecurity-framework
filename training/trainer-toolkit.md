# Trainer Toolkit  
### Using the AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™ with Older Adults

This toolkit is for **librarians, senior center staff, caregivers, and community educators** who want to use the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™** and **Senior CyberHero Missions™** in real-world settings.

You do **not** need to be a cybersecurity expert.  
You just need patience, curiosity, and a willingness to learn alongside your participants.

## 1️⃣ Before Your Session

### 🧾 1.1 Review the Framework (10 minutes)

- Skim the main [framework overview](../README.md).  
- Note the four pillars and that **Pillar 1 – Awareness & Devices (NIST)** is the current focus.  
- Remember the simple goal:  
  > Help seniors notice when something feels “off” and respond early.

### 📄 1.2 Choose 1–2 Missions

Start small. For a 45–60 minute session:

- Pick one or two scenarios from:  
  - [missions/](../missions/)  

Good first choices:

- **Late-Night Text**  
- **Doctor Portal Email**

### 🖨 1.3 Print or Prepare Materials

- Print the **Pillar 1 Awareness Checklist**:  
  - `missions/pillar-1-awareness-checklist.md`  
- Optionally print the scenarios or keep them open on your laptop/tablet.  
- Have a pen and paper available for participants who like to write notes.

## 2️⃣ During the Session

### 🙋 2.1 Set the Tone

Open with something like:

> “Today isn’t about making anyone feel behind.  
> It’s about practicing a few simple ways to stay safer online together.”

Remind everyone:

- There are **no dumb questions**.  
- They are allowed to say, “I don’t know what this means.”  
- The internet changes fast — it’s okay to learn in layers.

---

### 📖 2.2 Read One Scenario at a Time

For each mission:

1. **Read the “Situation” section aloud.**  
2. Ask the group:  
   - “What stands out to you?”  
   - “How would this make you feel?”  
3. Move to the **Awareness Check** questions.  
   - Ask them *before* you reveal the “What To Do” section.  
4. Invite participants to answer in their own words.  
5. Then share the recommended action and explanation.

You are **guiding a conversation**, not giving a quiz.

---

### 🧠 2.3 Use the Awareness Checklist

After the scenario discussion:

- Hand out or display the **Pillar 1 Awareness Checklist**.  
- Connect it back to the scenario:
  - Strange time?  
  - Unexpected message?  
  - Urgent pressure?  
  - Story didn’t match real life?

Invite seniors to keep the checklist near:

- Their phone  
- Their computer  
- Their mail table  

---

## 3️⃣ After the Session

### 🔁 3.1 Encourage “One Thing” Practice

Ask each participant:

> “What is one thing you’ll do differently after today?”

Examples:

- “I’ll pause before clicking links in texts.”  
- “I’ll log into my bank my own way, not through a message.”  
- “I’ll ask my daughter to double-check suspicious emails with me.”

Small commitments build real safety.

---

### 🗣 3.2 Invite Stories

At future sessions, ask:

> “Did anyone see something online this week that made you think of our checklist?”

Use their real experiences as future teaching moments.

---

## 4️⃣ Accessibility & Emotional Safety

Working with older adults means supporting:

- Different learning speeds  
- Different comfort levels with technology  
- Different emotional reactions (fear, embarrassment, frustration)

### 🧩 Tips:

- Speak slowly and repeat key ideas.  
- Avoid jargon. Use phrases like “strange message” instead of “malicious payload.”  
- Normalize asking for help:  
  > “Cybersecurity professionals ask for help too — you don’t have to figure it out alone.”  
- Never shame someone for falling for a scam in the past.  
  Instead:  
  > “Thank you for sharing that — you just helped someone else avoid the same trap.”

---

## 5️⃣ When to Escalate

You are **an educator**, not tech support or law enforcement.  
However, you can gently guide participants to the right next step if something serious comes up.

Advise seniors to:

- Contact their **bank or credit union** using the phone number on the back of their card.  
- Call their **doctor’s office** using the number on a bill or appointment reminder.  
- Ask a trusted family member or caregiver to help if they feel overwhelmed.  
- If money has been stolen or accounts were opened in their name, consider contacting:  
  - Local law enforcement  
  - State consumer protection agencies  
  - The bank’s fraud department  

You don’t have to fix everything.  
You help them **recognize** when something is wrong and **take the next safe step**.

---

## 6️⃣ Adapting the Missions

Feel free to:

- Change character names to fit your community  
- Translate key ideas into another language  
- Read scenarios more than once  
- Break missions into multiple shorter sessions  

The only requirement:

> Keep the core safety lesson intact and give credit to  
> **“AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™ – Aqueelah Emanuel, AQ’S Corner LLC.”**

---
