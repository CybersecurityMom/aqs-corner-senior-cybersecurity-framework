# Trainer Guide – Using the AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™

This guide is for librarians, senior center staff, caregivers, community leaders, and anyone who wants to teach cybersecurity to older adults using the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™**.

## Who This Is For

- Senior centers and community programs  
- Libraries running digital literacy or cybersecurity events  
- Caregiver support groups  
- Veteran and retirement communities  
- Faith-based and neighborhood organizations  

You do **not** need to be a cybersecurity expert to use this framework.  
You just need patience, empathy, and a willingness to walk through the pillars one step at a time.

## Recommended Session Formats

### 1. One-Hour Intro Session

**Goal:** Introduce all four pillars at a high level.

   - Why seniors are targeted  
   - Reassure: “This is about feeling confident, not perfect.”

2. **Pillar Overviews (35 min total)**  
   - Awareness & Devices (NIST) – 10 min  
   - Settings & Privacy (CIS) – 10 min  
   - Digital Habits & Credentials (SANS) – 7–10 min  
   - Online Safety & Behavior (ISO) – 7–10 min  

3. **Simple Q&A + Takeaway (15–20 min)**

### 2. Four-Week Series (One Pillar per Week)

**Week 1 – Awareness & Devices (NIST)**  
Focus on knowing devices, spotting strange behavior, and asking for help early.

**Week 2 – Settings & Privacy (CIS)**  
Walk through updates, privacy settings, and locking devices.

**Week 3 – Digital Habits & Credentials (SANS)**  
Practice creating strong passphrases and setting up screen locks.

**Week 4 – Online Safety & Behavior (ISO)**

## Tips for Teaching Seniors

- **Go slow, not shallow.** Simple doesn’t mean childish.  
- **Repeat the why.** “This keeps your money, identity, and peace of mind safer.”  
- **Encourage questions.** If they’re asking, they’re learning.  
- **Normalize not knowing.** Technology changes fast; you’re learning together.  
- **Invite them to bring real-life examples.** Scam emails, texts, pop-ups, letters.

## Using Senior CyberHero Missions

As missions are added under `./missions`, trainers can:

- Assign missions as “homework”  
- Run them live as group activities  
- Use them as conversation starters in recurring programs

Each mission will map back to one or more pillars in the framework.
