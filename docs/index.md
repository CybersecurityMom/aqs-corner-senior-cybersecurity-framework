## 🔹 What This Site Is

This site is the home of the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™**  
— a human–centered model created by **Aqueelah Emanuel** to make cybersecurity:

- Understandable  
- Practical  
- Dignified  

for **older adults, caregivers, and community educators**.

It is built from the principles of:

- **NIST** (Awareness & Devices)  
- **CIS Benchmarks** (Settings & Privacy)  
- **SANS Controls** (Digital Habits & Credentials)  
- **ISO Standards** (Online Safety & Behavior)  

We start with what matters most:

> **Helping seniors recognize when something doesn’t feel right online.**

## 🧱 The Four Pillars at a Glance

The **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™** is organized into four pillars:

1. **Awareness & Devices (NIST)**  
   Notice strange timing, odd messages, or unusual activity — and respond early.

2. **Settings & Privacy (CIS)**  
   Keep devices updated, tighten privacy, limit permissions, and lock what matters.

3. **Digital Habits & Credentials (SANS)**  
   Build safer day–to–day habits: passwords, screen locks, and regular checkups.

4. **Online Safety & Behavior (ISO)**  
   Practice safe sharing, safe shopping, and safe connections.

Right now, the live materials on this site focus on **Pillar 1 – Awareness & Devices (NIST).**

These are **real-life scenarios** older adults recognize from everyday life.  
They are designed to be read aloud, discussed in groups, or used one-on-one.

   A bank text arrives close to midnight saying your account is locked.

   An email claims your medical test results are ready, but you never had a test.
