---

## 🟦 Situation  
You’re browsing a familiar website when suddenly a loud pop-up appears:

> “WARNING! Your computer has a virus. Do not close this window! Call this number now!”

It feels scary.  
The screen looks official.  
But something feels “too dramatic.”

---

## 🟦 Your Awareness Check  
- **Does your real device usually shout at you?** No.  
- **Does the message use fear or urgency?** Yes.  
- **Does a real company force you to call a number?** Never.

---

## 🟦 Your Cyber Safety Choice  
**A)** Call the number to “fix it”  
**B)** Close the browser tab or restart the device

✔ **Correct Choice: B**

---

## 🟦 Why This Keeps You Safe  
These pop-ups are designed to scare seniors into paying fake fees or giving remote access.

Closing the tab breaks the scam instantly.

## 🟦 Trainer Notes  
Have seniors talk through:  
- “Have you ever seen something like this?”  
- “What made it feel real?”  
- “How did you react emotionally?”
