# Senior CyberHero Missions™

Senior CyberHero Missions™ are guided digital safety activities designed for older adults and the people who support them.

Each mission connects directly to one of the four pillars of the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™**:

- Awareness & Devices (NIST)
- Settings & Privacy (CIS)
- Digital Habits & Credentials (SANS)
- Online Safety & Behavior (ISO)

> **This section currently focuses ONLY on Pillar 1 missions.  
> Missions for Pillars 2–4 will be added as the Senior CyberHero series expands.**

Missions are meant to be:

- Simple enough for seniors to follow  
- Flexible enough for trainers to adapt  
- Practical enough to use in real-life situations

# ⭐ Current Mission Focus: Pillar 1 – Awareness & Devices (NIST)

We are beginning the Senior CyberHero Missions™ series with **Pillar 1**, the most foundational and confidence-building part of the framework.

Pillar 1 focuses on helping seniors:

- Recognize when something feels “off”
- Notice strange timing, unexpected messages, or urgent pressure
- Pause before reacting
- Ask for help early

These skills support NIST’s **Identify → Detect → Respond** principles in a simple, human-centered way.
