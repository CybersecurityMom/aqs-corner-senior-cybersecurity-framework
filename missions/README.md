# Senior CyberHero Missions

Senior CyberHero Missions are guided digital safety activities designed for older adults and the people who support them.

Each mission connects directly to one of the four pillars of the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™**:

1. Awareness & Devices (NIST)
2. Settings & Privacy (CIS)
3. Digital Habits & Credentials (SANS)
4. Online Safety & Behavior (ISO)

Missions are meant to be:

- Simple enough for seniors to follow
- Flexible enough for trainers to adapt
- Practical enough to use in real-life situations

## Mission Format (Template)

Each mission will generally follow this structure:

- **Pillar:** (Which of the four pillars this mission supports)
- **Mission Name:**
- **Goal:** (What seniors should be able to do or understand by the end)
- **Scenario:** (A short, realistic story or situation)
- **Steps:** (Guided actions, questions, or tasks)
- **Debrief:** (Key takeaways and reflection questions)

## Coming Soon

Sample missions will be added here as the Senior CyberHero series expands.  
Planned mission types include:

- Email & text message “Spot the Scam” scenarios  
- Device settings walk-throughs  
- Password and screen lock checkups  
- Safe shopping and Wi-Fi practice missions  

All missions will be aligned to the four pillars in this repository.
