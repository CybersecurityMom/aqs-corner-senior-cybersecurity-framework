**Pillar 1 – Awareness & Devices (NIST)**  
Part of the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™**

---

## 🟦 Situation  
You receive an email that says:

> “Your medical test results are ready. Click here to view.”

But you had no recent appointment.  
No bloodwork.  
No scans.

---

## 🟦 Your Awareness Check  
- **Is this tied to something you remember?** No.  
- **Did you recently talk to your doctor?** No.  
- **Does the email address look unfamiliar?** Often yes.

---

## 🟦 Your Cyber Safety Choice  
**A)** Click the link because it might be important  
**B)** Ignore the email and log in to your health portal the way you normally do

✔ **Correct Choice: B**

---

## 🟦 Why This Keeps You Safe  
Health-related phishing is one of the most common scams targeting seniors.  
If the message isn’t tied to your actual medical timeline, it’s suspicious.

## 🟦 Trainer Notes  
Discuss real doctor workflows:  
- “Does your provider normally text, call, or email?”  
- “Did you even take a test?”  
- “Does your portal send notifications?”
