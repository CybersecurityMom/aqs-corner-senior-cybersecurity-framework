# Senior CyberHero Life Scenario #1 – The Late-Night Text  
**Pillar 1 – Awareness & Devices (NIST)**  
Part of the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™**

---

## 🟦 Situation  
It’s almost midnight. You’re getting ready for bed when you receive a text:

> “Your bank account has been locked. Tap here to restore access.”

You weren’t expecting this. And the timing feels strange.

---

## 🟦 Your Awareness Check  
Ask yourself:

- **Is this a strange time?** Banks don’t text this late.  
- **Is this unexpected?** You didn’t contact your bank.  
- **Is there pressure?** “Immediately” is a red flag.

---

## 🟦 Your Cyber Safety Choice  
**A)** Tap the link to fix it  
**B)** Ignore the message and check your bank your usual way

✔ **Correct Choice: B**  
Go directly to your bank’s website or app — NOT through a text link.

---

## 🟦 Why This Keeps You Safe  
Scammers use urgency at odd hours because tired people react quickly.  
NIST calls this **Detect & Respond** — you recognized it early.

---

## 🟦 Trainer Notes  
Ask seniors:  
- “Does your bank usually text you?”  
- “Is this timing normal?”  
- “How does urgency make messages feel?”
