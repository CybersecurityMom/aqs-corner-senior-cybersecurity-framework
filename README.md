# AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™

A human-centered cybersecurity framework for seniors — and for the people who train them.

This repository hosts the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™**, a modern, practical adaptation of four major cybersecurity frameworks:

- **NIST** (National Institute of Standards and Technology)
- **CIS** (Center for Internet Security)
- **SANS Controls**
- **ISO Standards** (International Organization for Standardization)

The goal is simple and ambitious:

> **Make cybersecurity teachable, believable, and usable for seniors — without dumbing it down.**

## 🌐 The Framework at a Glance

![AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model](images/aqs-senior-framework.png)

> **Awareness & Devices (NIST)  
> Settings & Privacy (CIS)  
> Digital Habits & Credentials (SANS)  
> Online Safety & Behavior (ISO)**

This model keeps the integrity of the original frameworks, but restructures them in **plain English** so seniors and trainers can focus on what actually matters day-to-day.

## 🧩 Pillar 1: Awareness & Devices (NIST → “Know, Protect, Notice, Respond”)

**Based on:** NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)

NIST is a foundational framework used by federal agencies, hospitals, and enterprises.  
For seniors, we simplify the core ideas into four actions:

- **Know it** – Know your devices and accounts (phone, tablet, email, apps).
- **Protect it** – Turn on protections (passwords, updates, security tools).
- **Notice it** – Pay attention to strange messages, pop-ups, or logins.
- **Respond early** – Ask for help as soon as something feels off.

This pillar is about **awareness**: understanding what you have and recognizing when something doesn’t look right.

---

## 🛡 Pillar 2: Settings & Privacy (CIS → “Update, Tighten, Limit, Lock”)

**Based on:** CIS Benchmarks and CIS Critical Security Controls

CIS focuses on hardening systems — closing the easy doors that attackers use.  
For seniors, we focus on:

- **✓ Update** – Keep devices and apps updated to fix vulnerabilities.
- **✓ Tighten** – Adjust security and privacy settings.
- **✓ Limit** – Reduce app permissions (camera, mic, location, contacts).
- **✓ Lock** – Use device locks (PIN, fingerprint, passcode).

This pillar is about **control**: giving seniors and trainers a simple checklist for strengthening devices without overwhelming them.

---

## 🔑 Pillar 3: Digital Habits & Credentials (SANS → “Passwords, Checkups, Screen Locks”)

**Based on:** SANS Security Controls and secure behavior best practices

SANS is known for practical, real-world security. Here, we emphasize everyday habits:

- **✓ Passwords** – Use strong, memorable passphrases instead of weak short passwords.
- **✓ Checkups** – Periodically review accounts, devices, and settings.
- **✓ Screen locks** – Ensure devices lock when not in use.

This pillar is about **habit-building**: small, repeatable actions that dramatically lower risk.

---

## 🌍 Pillar 4: Online Safety & Behavior (ISO → “Safe Sharing, Safe Shopping, Safe Connections”)

**Based on:** ISO standards for information security and online trust

ISO provides a global lens for safe digital behavior. For seniors, this becomes:

- **✓ Safe sharing** – Be careful with personal information; avoid sharing via links or unknown messages.
- **✓ Safe shopping** – Use trusted websites and verify URLs before entering payment details.
- **✓ Safe connections** – Favor secure Wi-Fi and be skeptical of unsolicited messages, links, and calls.

This pillar is about **judgment and caution**: empowering seniors to trust their instincts and use simple rules to stay safer online.

## 🎯 Why This Framework Exists

Age should never be a cybersecurity risk factor.

When older adults are pushed out of the digital conversation, we lose wisdom, insight, and generational strength — and scammers know it. They target seniors precisely because they appear isolated and unprotected.

Cybersecurity, at its core, isn’t just about code, tools, and firewalls; it’s about people. And we cannot keep building programs that serve only one age group.

When seniors feel confident online, families become safer, communities become safer, workplaces become safer, caregivers and children become safer.

This framework is part of a larger movement I’m building — a mother-daughter, community-centered mission to make cybersecurity **inclusive, accessible, and deeply human**.

It’s designed for:

- Libraries  
- Senior centers  
- Church groups  
- Veteran communities  
- AARP chapters  
- Families  
- Caregivers  
- Educators  
- Workplaces  

Cybersecurity belongs to all of us.

## 🚀 Senior CyberHero Missions (What’s Coming Next)

This model is just the beginning.

I’m expanding this work into a series of **Senior CyberHero Missions**, printable resources, and hands-on digital safety activities designed specifically for older adults and those who support them.

All of it is rooted in this framework — and all of it is built on one core belief:

> **Every generation deserves digital confidence.**

## 🧭 How to Use This Repository

You can use this framework to:

- **Train seniors directly** – Use the four pillars as a teaching outline.  
- **Train trainers** – Librarians, senior center staff, caregivers, and community leaders.  
- **Design workshops** – Build lesson plans or community events around each pillar.  
- **Build your own materials** – Slides, handouts, checklists, or activities mapped to each pillar.

As this repository grows, you’ll find:

- `missions/` – Senior CyberHero Missions and exercises  
- `training/` – Guides for trainers and facilitators  
- `images/` – Visual assets and diagrams

## 👩🏾‍💻 About the Creator

This framework was created by **Aqueelah Emanuel**, Founder of **AQ’S Corner LLC** — a mother-daughter cybersecurity education initiative focused on families, seniors, and communities that are too often overlooked in traditional security training.

My work sits at the intersection of **caregiving, community, cybersecurity, and digital empowerment**, and this framework represents one part of a much larger mission to ensure no generation is left behind.

> **This is the beginning of a new standard.** One where cybersecurity is not reserved for the tech-savvy or the young, but shared across generations with dignity, clarity, and purpose. If we want a safer digital future, it starts with frameworks like this — and with the courage to teach those who’ve been overlooked for far too long.
