# Start Here

Welcome to the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™** repository.

If you're a senior center coordinator, librarian, caregiver, or community educator, begin with:

### 1️⃣ Review the Framework  
→ Read the main `README.md`  
→ Look at the four pillars  
→ Understand how the model is structured

### 2️⃣ Begin With Pillar 1  
This is the easiest, safest, and most confidence-building entry point for seniors.

### 3️⃣ Use the Senior CyberHero Scenarios  
These are real-life, relatable stories seniors can discuss and practice.

Start with:  
- Scenario 1: Late-Night Text  
- Scenario 2: Doctor Portal Email  
- Scenario 3: Warning Pop-Up

### 4️⃣ Print the Awareness Checklist  
Use this in workshops or one-on-one sessions.

### 5️⃣ Stay tuned  
More missions for Pillar 1 followed by Pillars 2–4 will be added soon.




# AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™

A human-centered cybersecurity model designed to support seniors, caregivers, and community educators with simple, practical safety practices rooted in respected cybersecurity standards.

This repository hosts the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™**, created by **Aqueelah Emanuel**, Founder of **AQ’S Corner LLC**, and inspired by principles from:

- **NIST** — National Institute of Standards and Technology  
- **CIS Benchmarks** — Center for Internet Security  
- **SANS Controls**  
- **ISO Standards** — International Organization for Standardization  

The goal is simple:

> **Make cybersecurity understandable, usable, and empowering for older adults — without losing the integrity of the original standards.**

# 🌐 The Framework Overview

The model is built on four pillars:

### 🔵 Pillar 1 — Awareness & Devices (NIST)  
Recognize when something feels “off,” notice unusual digital activity, and respond early.

### 🟪 Pillar 2 — Settings & Privacy (CIS)  
Update devices, tighten settings, limit permissions, and lock what matters.

### 🟨 Pillar 3 — Digital Habits & Credentials (SANS)  
Passwords, checkups, and safe device behaviors.

### 🟩 Pillar 4 — Online Safety & Behavior (ISO)  
Safe sharing, safe shopping, and safe connections.

# ⭐ Current Focus: Pillar 1 – Awareness & Devices (NIST)

We are beginning the Senior CyberHero Missions™ series with **Pillar 1**, the most foundational and confidence-building part of the framework.

Pillar 1 teaches seniors to:

- Recognize when something feels “off”  
- Notice strange timing, unexpected messages, or urgent pressure  
- Pause before reacting  
- Ask for help early  

These align with NIST’s **Identify → Detect → Respond** lifecycle in a simple, plain-English way.
