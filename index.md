# 💙 AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™

*A national initiative to empower seniors with simple, trusted cybersecurity practices.*

---

## 👋 Welcome

This site is the home of the **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™** —  
a human–centered model created by **Aqueelah Emanuel (AQ’S Corner LLC)** to make cybersecurity:

- Understandable  
- Practical  
- Dignified  

for **older adults, caregivers, and community educators**.

It is inspired by the principles of:

- **NIST** – Awareness & Devices  
- **CIS Benchmarks** – Settings & Privacy  
- **SANS Controls** – Digital Habits & Credentials  
- **ISO Standards** – Online Safety & Behavior  

> We start where it matters most:  
> **Helping seniors notice when something doesn’t feel right online.**

## 🧱 The Four Pillars at a Glance

The **AQ’S Corner Senior Cybersecurity Framework Model™** is organized into four pillars:

1. 🔵 **Awareness & Devices (NIST)**  
   Notice strange timing, unexpected messages, or unusual activity — and respond early.

2. 🟣 **Settings & Privacy (CIS)**  
   Keep devices updated, tighten privacy, limit permissions, and lock what matters.

3. 🟡 **Digital Habits & Credentials (SANS)**  
   Build safer day–to–day habits: passwords, screen locks, and regular checkups.

4. 🟢 **Online Safety & Behavior (ISO)**  
   Practice safe sharing, safe shopping, and safe connections.

> **What’s live today:** Pillar 1 – Awareness & Devices (NIST).  
> Other pillars will be added as the program grows.

They are designed to be read aloud, discussed in groups, or used one-on-one.

   A bank text arrives close to midnight saying your account is locked.
